**Seq2SeqGAN model**

To the baseline LSTM model, we applied GAN architecture and created a new model. We call this model as SeqtoSeq GAN here. With the GANâ€™s generator and discriminator, we expected that our model generates more plausible future positions, avoiding the blurry predictions with the help of discriminator. Figure1 and Figure2 two shows the architecture of the generator and the discriminator of our Seq2Seq model.
