            <p>Autonomous vehicles are the future of on land mobility for mankind. But, we are still far from seamless autonomous transportation and we need to resolve many significant challenges before we can truly travel autonomously. One of the most important aspects of any autonomous vehicle is its ability to predict the next moves of other agents. The challenge to predict the next move is significant for its success. It's of utmost importance to correctly predict the next position of other vehicles as it will not only determine the direction in which the vehicle should move but will also impact the safety of the passenger and also others on the road. What makes this challenge even more critical is the fact that the next position of the vehicle should be determined keeping in mind not only the surroundings but also the destination and traffic agents. The impact of this solution is enormous in autonomous vehicles being successful and making transportation seamless and safe which has been a driving force behind us choosing to work on this problem statement. It is an exciting opportunity to work on a problem that will solve some pressing real world use cases and make a global impact.</p>
